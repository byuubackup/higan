higan is a multi-system emulator from [byuu](https://byuu.org/about) with an
uncompromising focus on accuracy and code readability.

It is a research project meant to improve all emulators through open source
collaboration, and as such is not meant to be used as a standard emulator for
playing games (although it can be used as such with some patience.)

Testing is greatly appreciated so that the emulation quality can be improved.
Such improvements will migrate downstream to user-focused emulators such as
bsnes.

It currently emulates the following systems: Famicom, Famicom Disk System,
Super Famicom, Super Game Boy, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance,
Game Boy Player, SG-1000, SC-3000, Master System, Game Gear, Mega Drive,
Mega CD, PC Engine, SuperGrafx, MSX, MSX2, ColecoVision, Neo Geo Pocket,
Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, WonderSwan Color, SwanCrystal,
Pocket Challenge V2.

Development
-----------

Git is used for the development of new releases, and represents a staging
environment. As higan is rather mature, things should generally be quite stable.
However, bugs will exist, regressions will occur, so proceed at your own risk.

If stability is required, please download the latest stable release from the
[official website.](https://byuu.org/higan)
